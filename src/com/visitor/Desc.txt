The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new behaviors to an existing object structure without modifying its code. The pattern involves defining a separate visitor object that encapsulates the behavior and allows it to be applied to the object structure.

The Visitor pattern is particularly useful when you have a complex object structure, and you want to perform some operation on each element of the structure, but you don't want to modify the objects themselves.

---------

In this example, we define an interface called Visitor that has two methods, one for each type of element that we want to visit. We then define two classes that implement this interface, NameVisitor and ValueVisitor, which implement the respective visit methods.

We also define two classes that represent elements in our object structure, ElementA and ElementB, which both implement the Element interface. Each of these classes has an accept method that takes a Visitor object as a parameter and calls the appropriate visit method on that object.

Finally, in the Client class, we create an array of Element objects, and then create instances of our NameVisitor and ValueVisitor classes. We then loop through the elements, calling the accept method on each element, passing in both visitors. This results in both visitors visiting each element and performing their respective behaviors.
